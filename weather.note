## OK....

# after implementing the algorithm in a way I would expect to work, I am only
# receiving correct results 1/3 of the time...

Therefore to help debug, I will try run the program against a simple collection
of weather data whose conditional probabilities and MAP estimators can be
worked out by hand...

then I can see if my code is making mistakes or if naive bayes classification
is just this inaccurrate for the given tic-tac-toe case!


--> ok, so the program successfully parses the training and test data for the weather attempt, and correctly sorts the occurrences of each piece of evidence into frequencies... (i.e. training_freqs is in agreement with a table I drew up on paper by hand)

on to calculating conditional probs, then MAP for test data.


---> ok!!  calculating conditional probabilities worked just fine. on to MAP...



---> MAP works fine in the sense that it's math matches my hand calculations.. so I guess the algorithm works just fine and I should just place little faith in naive bayesian classifiers for this purpose given the small data set.
