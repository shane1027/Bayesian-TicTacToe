## OK....

# after implementing the algorithm in a way I would expect to work, I am only
# receiving correct results 1/3 of the time...

Therefore to help debug, I will try run the program against a simple collection
of weather data whose conditional probabilities and MAP estimators can be
worked out by hand...

then I can see if my code is making mistakes or if naive bayes classification
is just this inaccurrate for the given tic-tac-toe case!
